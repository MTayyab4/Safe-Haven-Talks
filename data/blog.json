Mama Duck was busy leading his siblings in a diving lesson, their tiny bodies splashing happily. One moment Quack was watching, the next, a particularly juicy beetle caught his eye, wiggling near a clump of daisies. Before he knew it, Quack had waddled off the edge of the pond and into the unknown farmyard." },

A majestic brown horse whinnied a greeting, its long mane flowing in the breeze. A gaggle of fluffy white sheep looked at Quack with wide, curious eyes." },

He began to feel a little lost, a tiny peep escaping his beak. A large shadow fell upon him, and Quack looked up to see the friendly cow." },

From then on, he explored with Mama Duck close by, their quacks a comforting duet as they waddled side by side. The farmyard held many wonders, but the greatest adventure of all was being safe and happy with his family."},
